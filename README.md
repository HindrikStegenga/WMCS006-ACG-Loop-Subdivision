WMCS006-ACG-Loop-Subdivision

This is a mesh subdivision program build as part of the Advanced Computer Graphics course at the RUG.

It includes:
- Loop subdivision using masks and curve subdivision at boundaries.
- Half Edge datastructure for storing vertices.
- Smoothness visualization using reflection lines. 
- Fully configurable direction for these reflection lines.
- Vertex selection using NDC space calculations abusing the feedback buffer.
- Edge selection using NDC space calculations abusing the feedback buffer.

It uses OpenGL for rendering.
